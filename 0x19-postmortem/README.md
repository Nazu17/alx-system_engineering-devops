0x19. Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: March 10, 2024, 09:00 GMT
End Time: March 10, 2024, 12:30 GMT
Impact:
The outage affected the authentication service, causing intermittent login failures and delays.
Approximately 20% of users experienced disruptions during the incident.
Timeline:

Detection:

March 10, 2024, 09:15 GMT - Issue detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed login attempts.
March 10, 2024, 09:20 GMT - Engineers notified of the incident.
Actions Taken:

March 10, 2024, 09:30 GMT - Initial investigation focused on the authentication server logs to identify potential issues.
March 10, 2024, 10:00 GMT - Assumption: Suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in login requests. Increased server capacity to mitigate.
March 10, 2024, 10:30 GMT - Escalated incident to the security team to analyze network traffic for signs of malicious activity.
March 10, 2024, 11:00 GMT - Misleading path: No evidence of a DDoS attack found. Attention shifted to database connections.
March 10, 2024, 11:30 GMT - Incident escalated to the database administration team.
Resolution:

March 10, 2024, 12:00 GMT - In-depth analysis revealed a bottleneck in the database connection pool, causing authentication delays.
March 10, 2024, 12:15 GMT - Adjusted database connection pool settings to handle increased load efficiently.
March 10, 2024, 12:30 GMT - Full service restoration confirmed.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The primary cause was a misconfigured database connection pool, leading to delays in processing authentication requests.
The misconfiguration resulted in a backlog of authentication attempts, causing intermittent service disruptions.
Resolution:

Database connection pool settings were optimized to accommodate higher authentication request volumes.
Implemented additional monitoring to detect and alert on database connection pool issues in real-time.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct regular audits of critical service configurations to proactively identify and address potential bottlenecks.
Enhance monitoring to include advanced analytics on authentication requests, aiding in early detection of anomalies.
Tasks:

Short-term:
Conduct a thorough review of all critical service configurations to identify and rectify potential bottlenecks.
Update incident response protocols to include misconfigurations in the authentication flow.
Long-term:
Implement automated scaling for critical services to handle sudden spikes in user activity.
Provide additional training for operations and security teams on recognizing and responding to authentication-related issues.
